# Rubyscholar

# Synopsis

Here is a small script to "scrape" your Google Scholar citations and reformat them (the way I need it for my website). 
Not super flexible - but should be easily customizable.

Some features: 

 * if registered on Crossref, retreives corresponding DOIs and can add altmetric.org links. 
   If Crossref doesn't think your email is valid, no DOIs will be retreived. 
 * adds "Cited by N" for popular papers

# How to use:

### As a ruby script:
1. Configure "config.yml"
   If you want DOI retreival to work (including Altmetrics), you need to be 
   registered at crossref (its free). 
2. Run `ruby bin/scrape.rb` 
3. A scholar.html file is created with your publications from google scholar. 
4. Thats it. 

# Potential for improvement:

 * uses author list as visible on your main Google Scholar page. Sometimes this 
   means names are chopped in two or just a single author is missing. This could
   be made smarter (by following the link to get the full author list). 
 * output format could be more flexible. (e.g. change order (eg title before authors), or change formatting (e.g. remove first initial)). Perhaps this could be done with by providing a regexp search/replace configuration option within each field.
 * Ensure that a true email is entered. 
 * right now only works from "user profile" pages. Not from "articles citing article" pages. 
 * flexible use of DOIs

Ruby, Nokogiri. Thanks to Google Scholar and Crossref. I hope none of this infringes on anything.
